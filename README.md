CUHK网红教授Xin Wang大战网友 CUHK’s First Internet Celebrity: Xin Wang’s All-Night Rednote Showdown with Netizens

起初是有个朋友在小红书问这个导师怎么样，有个别网友发了他的避雷，本来帖子没什么人看，结果导师本人当天注册账号，和网友通宵对骂，从第一天下午骂到了第二天早上。最后发现越骂越火，个性签名改成了“别跑，已报警”并且注销了账号，开始举报各种有他照片的帖子，理由是侵犯肖像权or名誉权，后所有帖子被删，成为香港中文大学历史上的光辉一战。该贴最后观战网友上万，点赞上千，收藏上百。你或许见过很多垃圾导师，但是没有见过亲自回怼陌生网友的垃圾导师吧。为保护相关用户，部分时间和用户名被隐去。以下所有内容来源于网络上流传的一些内容，不全面，但是可以看到当初对骂盛况空前绝后。
It all started when a friend asked about this advisor on Xiaohongshu, and a few users shared their warnings about him. Initially, the post didn’t attract much attention, but then the advisor himself registered an account that very day and engaged in an all-night argument with netizens—starting in the afternoon and continuing until the next morning.

As the debate gained traction, he only fueled the fire. Eventually, he changed his profile bio to "Don't run, I've called the police" before deleting his account. After that, he began reporting every post containing his photo, citing infringement of portrait rights or defamation, leading to the deletion of all related posts. This incident became a legendary battle in the history of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

By the end, tens of thousands had watched the spectacle unfold, with the post garnering thousands of likes and hundreds of saves. You may have seen terrible advisors before, but have you ever seen one personally engage in a flame war with random netizens?

以下内容来自于不同程度的导师评价网，该课题组几乎年年退学/转导率50%以上，该导师曾经被学生录音多次告到香港城市大学生物医学系，在被香港城市大学开除后，来到了香港中文大学外科系，来了不久后，和外科系的众多领导和合作方产生或大或小的矛盾。

The following information is sourced from various academic review platforms, reflecting different levels of evaluation. Reports indicate that this research group has consistently maintained an annual dropout or advisor transfer rate exceeding 50%, with a significant number of students leaving the program.

Xin Wang was repeatedly recorded by students and reported multiple times to the Department of Biomedical Sciences at City University of Hong Kong due to verbally abusing students, including calling them “idiots” (傻逼). During his tenure at CityU, nearly no students graduated on time—most were forced to extend their studies by six months to two years, and even upon graduation, they had little to no research output.

Xin was also reported to have threatened graduating students, demanding that they return to give lectures or attend meetings. He allegedly warned them that if they refused, he would prevent their papers from ever being published.

Following his dismissal from CityU, Xin joined the Department of Surgery at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). However, soon after his arrival, he experienced ongoing conflicts—both major and minor—with department leadership and various collaborators.

There have been allegations that Xin disparaged clinical professors in private conversations, referring to Professor NG Siu Man Simon and Professor LAU Yun Wong James in derogatory terms and questioning their expertise. Additionally, he was reported to have fabricated claims about his close professional relationships with Professor CHOK Siu Ho Kenneth and Dr. CHIU Ka Fung Peter, allegedly using these assertions to pressure them into supporting his research endeavors.

Furthermore, after gaining attention on Xiaohongshu, Xin allegedly instructed others to disseminate misleading information about Professor WONG Nathalie on the platform.

Despite spending several years in academia, Xin reportedly produced minimal research output while securing multiple research grants based on questionable or falsified results. Given that bioinformatics results are less scrutinized for fabrication compared to wet-lab experiments, he allegedly increasingly pressured students to generate results that aligned with his expectations to secure further funding.

Even years after completing his PhD, Xin continued working on CMS subtyping from his doctoral research, failing to develop any independent research direction of his own. Most of his published work is reported to have been led by others, indicating a lack of ability to independently lead research projects.
